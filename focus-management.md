## Question 1: What is Deep Work?
**Deep Work** is a state of focused, uninterrupted, and distraction-free concentration on a cognitively demanding task. Coined by Cal Newport, it allows individuals to produce better results in less time and helps in mastering complicated information and skills.


## Question 2: According to the author, how to do deep work properly?
- Establish rituals and routines that support deep work sessions.
- Allow yourself to be bored; don't reach for distractions when you're not stimulated.
- Use digital tools selectively—only those that provide substantial benefit.
- Reduce time spent on shallow tasks like emails and meetings.


## Question 3: How can you implement the principles in your day-to-day life?
- Set a specific time daily for deep work (e.g., 9–11 a.m. every day).
- Keep your phone on silent or in another room during deep work hours.
- Use focus techniques like Pomodoro or time-blocking.
- Identify and minimize shallow tasks by scheduling them outside your deep work time.
- Take digital detox breaks during the week to restore focus.

## Question 4: What are the dangers of social media, in brief?
- Constant dopamine hits from likes, shares, and comments.
- Difficulty focusing on tasks due to frequent interruptions.
- Feelings of anxiety, inadequacy, or FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
- Hours can be lost mindlessly scrolling through feeds.
- Oversharing and data misuse risks.
