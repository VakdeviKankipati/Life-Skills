## Listening and Active Communication

## Active Listening

# Question 1

# What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

- Show the speaker you are engaged by keeping consistent and respectful eye contact.  
- Try to understand the speaker’s emotions and perspective. Respond with compassion and validation.
- Listen without forming opinions or jumping to conclusions. Keep an open mind throughout the conversation.
- Don’t rush the speaker. Allow pauses and silences—it gives them space to think and express clearly.
- Pay attention to tone of voice, facial expressions, and gestures to fully understand the message beyond words.
- Give considered responses that show you’ve truly listened, rather than reacting impulsively or changing the subject.


## Reflective Listening

# Question 2

# According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)

# Key Points of Reflective Listening
- Use nodding, eye contact, and small words like “I see” or “Okay” to show you’re fully engaged.
- Address both what the speaker says and how they feel.  
- Be calm and don’t take sides. This helps especially in tense discussions or disagreements.
- Your job is to fully understand first. Sometimes people just want to be heard, not told what to do.
- If something is unclear, ask polite questions to understand better.  
- After a long explanation, summarize the key points so both of you are clear.

##  Reflection

# Question 3
# What are the obstacles in your listening process?
- If I’m under time pressure or thinking about my next meeting/task, I may not fully engage in the current conversation.
- Sometimes different accents or unfamiliar vocabulary can make it hard to follow.
- If someone talks too quickly or uses unfamiliar terms, I find it difficult to keep up and understand.
- I often get distracted by notifications or other tasks while someone is speaking. 
- I sometimes assume I already understand the topic or message, which causes me to stop listening actively.

# Question 4
# What can you do to improve your listening?

- Before starting a conversation or meeting, I can take a deep breath, mentally set aside upcoming tasks, and remind myself to focus only on the current discussion. Scheduling buffer time between meetings can also help reduce this pressure. 
- I can ask for clarification politely when I don’t understand something. Over time, exposing myself to diverse accents and industry-specific vocabulary (through videos, podcasts, or reading) will improve my comprehension.
- If someone speaks too quickly or uses unfamiliar terms, I can ask them to slow down or repeat key points. Taking quick notes helps me capture important details and stay engaged.
- I can silence phone notifications, close unrelated browser tabs, and give my full attention to the speaker. Choosing a quiet environment and using active listening techniques (like eye contact and nodding) also help.
- I can remind myself to listen with an open mind. Instead of assuming I already know what the speaker will say, I will let them finish and then paraphrase their points to confirm my understanding.

## Types of Communication

# Question 5
# When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

- When I’m afraid of being judged or misunderstood, I prefer to stay silent.
- If I think my opinion won’t be taken seriously, especially in a group of more experienced people.
- During conflicts with friends or family, I try to avoid escalation by just agreeing or withdrawing.
- When I feel that raising a concern might upset someone, I tend to ignore my own discomfort.
- In team meetings, if I’m unsure about the topic, I hold back instead of asking questions.

# Question 6
# When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

- When I feel my time is being wasted, especially if people don’t come prepared to a meeting or task.
- If I feel disrespected or interrupted repeatedly, I sometimes react strongly.
- While giving feedback under stress, I may sound blunt or overly critical.
- If someone talks down to me or takes credit for my work, I can become argumentative.
- When I feel I’m not being heard after repeated efforts, I may raise my voice or become very direct.

# Question 7
# When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

- When I want to express dissatisfaction but don’t feel comfortable doing it openly.
- If someone doesn’t follow through on a promise, I might make sarcastic remarks instead of confronting them.
- When I disagree with a decision but feel it’s too late to speak up, I might complain behind the scenes.
- If I feel hurt but don’t want to start a confrontation, I may use the silent treatment or delay responses.
- When I feel someone is constantly avoiding responsibility, I may make indirect comments to express frustration.

# Question 8
# How can you make your communication assertive?
- Think through what I want to say so I can express it clearly and confidently.
- Let others know I understand their point of view before sharing mine.
- Assertive communication is two-way. I’ll listen without interrupting and respond thoughtfully.
- The more I practice assertive responses, especially in tough situations, the more natural it will become.
- I’ll take a moment before responding to avoid reacting emotionally or aggressively.
