Stay Curious and Ask Why

    I’ll challenge myself not to just accept answers but to understand why things work the way they do.

Work Through Discomfort

    I’ll stay calm and focused when stuck, knowing that discomfort means growth is happening.

Set Weekly Growth Goals

    I’ll set realistic, stretch goals for my development (e.g., “Refactor X module,” “Contribute to open source”).

Learn One New Concept Daily

    I’ll commit to learning something small but meaningful every day—like a new algorithm, a design pattern, or a Git command.

Keep a Developer Journal

    I’ll track what I learn, questions I ask, bugs I fix, and how I feel. This builds self-awareness and shows progress.
