## Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg
## Question 1
## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea for me was Big changes don’t require big actions.  Massive behavior change can come from doing something really small, like flossing just one tooth or doing two pushups after using the bathroom. BJ Fogg's story about how he started with a tiny habit of doing just two pushups after going to the bathroom was incredibly powerful. It showed that habits don’t need to be big or dramatic to make a difference—they just need to be consistent and tied to an existing routine. Over time, these small actions naturally grow, not because of motivation, but because they become part of your identity and daily rhythm. 

## Question 2
## How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
The formula B = MAP comes from BJ Fogg’s behavior model and explains how behavior (B) happens when Motivation (M), Ability (A), and a Prompt (P) are all present at the same time.
M = Motivation
Your desire to do the behavior.
A = Ability
How easy it is to do the behavior.
P = Prompt
A reminder or trigger that tells you to do the behavior.

## Question 3
## Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
In “Tiny Habits” by BJ Fogg, it is important to “Shine” or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit because celebration creates a positive emotion, and emotion is what wires a habit into your brain.
BJ Fogg emphasizes that it’s not repetition alone that builds a habit—it’s the feeling of success that makes your brain want to do it again. When you celebrate immediately (like saying “Yes!”, smiling, doing a fist pump, or saying “I’m awesome!”), your brain associates the new habit with a good feeling, making it more likely to stick.

## Question 4
## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
In the video “1% Better Every Day” by James Clear, the most interesting idea for me was the story of the British Cycling Team. For years, they were performing poorly and had no major wins. But when they started focusing on tiny, 1% improvements in everything,from redesigning bike seats to choosing better massage gels and even bringing their own pillows to ensure good sleep, it completely transformed their performance.

## Book Summary of Atomic Habits

## Question 5
## What is the book's perspective about Identity?
the book’s perspective on identity is that true and lasting behavior change starts with changing your identity, not just your goals.

Instead of focusing on what you want to achieve, focus on who you want to become.

Every small habit you build is a vote for the type of person you want to be. The more you act in alignment with that identity, the stronger it becomes. For example:

. If you read every day, you become a reader.

. If you write every day, you become a writer.

So, identity-based habits help you create lasting change because you’re not just changing your actions—you’re changing your self-image. This leads to more consistent, automatic behaviors over time.

## Question 6
## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
In Atomic Habits, the book suggests that to make a habit easier to do, you should reduce friction and lower the barrier to starting. James Clear calls this the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: "Make it Easy."

## Question 7
## Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
In Atomic Habits, the book explains that to break a bad habit or do it less often, you need to make it harder to do. This aligns with the 4th Law of Behavior Change: "Make it Difficult."

## Question 8:
## Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
Habit I want to do more of:

Daily reading for at least 20 minutes.

1.Make the Cue Obvious:

    Keep my book or e-reader on my bedside table or desk, clearly visible.

2.Make the Habit Easy:

    Start with reading just 2 pages if I don’t feel motivated—using the 2-minute rule.

3.Make It More Attractive:

    Pair reading with a pleasant activity, like having a cup of tea or sitting in a cozy spot.

4.Make the Response Satisfying:

    Celebrate after reading by mentally acknowledging the progress (“I’m proud of myself!”).

## Question 9:
## Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
Habit I want to do less of:
Sleeping late at night.

Steps to Make Late-Night Sleeping Less Likely:

1.Make the Cue Invisible:

    Avoid using screens (phone, laptop, TV) at least 1 hour before bedtime since blue light triggers alertness.

2.Make the Process Harder:

    Set a strict “bedtime alarm” or reminder to start winding down.

3.Make It Unattractive:

    Remind yourself of the negative effects of late sleeping like tiredness, poor focus, and mood issues.

4.Make the Response Unsatisfying:

    Track your bedtime and how you feel the next day; notice the link between late sleep and low energy.
