# Learning Process
## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique

**Question 1**
**What is the Feynman Technique?**
The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you explain a concept in simple terms as if teaching a child, which reveals gaps in your understanding that you then fill by studying further.

## 2. Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley

**Question 2**
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**
The most interesting story in Barbara Oakley’s TED Talk was how she struggled with math growing up and even flunked it in school, but later in life, she retrained her brain and became a professor of engineering. Her journey shows that anyone can learn difficult subjects with the right mindset and techniques, like using the brain’s “diffused mode” and spaced repetition. It was inspiring because it proves that learning is a skill, not just a talent.

**Question 3**
**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**
- Active Mode of Thinking: when your brain is intensely focused on a problem—like when you're solving a math problem or studying something new with full concentration. It’s conscious and deliberate.

- Diffused Mode of Thinking: when a more relaxed state of mind where your brain makes broader connections in the background, like when you're taking a walk, showering, or daydreaming. It helps you understand complex ideas and come up with creative solutions.

## 3. Learn Anything in 20 hours

## Learning Principles in the Bootcamp

**Question 5**
**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

### Approach Learning with Curiosity and Joy
- Treat deadlines as guides, not stress points.  
- Make learning fun, creative, and personal.

### Improve Communication
- Share obstacles early.  
- Practice explaining concepts in clear and precise words.

### Practice Deep Work
- Eliminate distractions during study sessions (phone on silent, no social media).  
- Use tools like **Boosted**, **Freedom**, or **TimeLimit** to manage focus time.

### Learn by Teaching (Feynman Technique)
- Regularly explain concepts in simple language to others or write them in my own words.

### Use Both Active and Diffused Thinking
- Alternate between focused study sessions and relaxed activities to allow deep connections.

### Break Down New Topics (Learn in 20 Hours)
- Deconstruct new skills into small parts.  
- Practice deliberately for at least 20 focused hours per topic.
