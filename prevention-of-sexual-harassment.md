## Prevention of Sexual Harassment
## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes unwelcome and inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature that can be verbal, non-verbal, physical, or visual. Examples include:

- Unwanted touching or physical contact  
- Sexually suggestive remarks, jokes, or gestures  
- Inappropriate comments on appearance or body  
- Sharing sexually explicit content (messages, images, or videos)  
- Repeated requests for dates despite refusals  
- Stalking or following someone persistently  
- Displaying offensive material in the workplace  
- Making threats or promises in exchange for sexual favors  

Such acts create a hostile, intimidating, or uncomfortable work environment.

## 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or witness sexual harassment:

- Stay calm and document the incident(s) with date, time, location, and people involved  
- Confront the harasser (if safe) and clearly state that their behavior is unwelcome  
- Report the incident to the Internal Committee (IC) or designated PoSH authority in the organization as per the company's policy  
- Support the victim if I am a witness â€” encourage them to speak up and accompany them (if needed) to report the incident  
- Maintain confidentiality and avoid spreading information  
- Cooperate fully with the inquiry process
