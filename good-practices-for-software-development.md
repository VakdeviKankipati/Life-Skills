## Review Questions

### Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

- Tracking your work hours using productivity apps (like Boosted) to improve focus and accountability.
- Treating remote work with the same seriousness as on-site work, avoid multitasking during meetings.
- Using “Do Not Disturb” mode during deep work to reduce interruptions.
- Sending grouped questions in one message instead of multiple pings to respect others’ time.
- Avoiding assumptions; always confirm when unclear about a task or expectation.

### Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- Over-communicating” and “asking better questions when stuck.”
- I sometimes delay asking for help hoping I’ll figure it out, which leads to time loss.
- My queries to teammates can sometimes be too short or lack sufficient context.
- I also tend to default to DMs instead of posting in group channels.
- If I’m stuck for more than 30 minutes, I’ll ask for help. Before that, I’ll document what I’ve tried, and summarize it neatly for the team.
- This format will reduce the back-and-forth and make it easier for others to help me quickly.
